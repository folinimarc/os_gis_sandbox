  \begin{abstract}
    It is generally desirable in educational GIS workshops to supplement the
    theoretical concepts with hands-on exercises in order for participants to
    become an active part in the learning experience. This requires that
    participants have access to an environment that provides the necessary
    software and data - ideally with minimal setup effort, independent of the
    system they use and easy to uninstall without leaving traces after the
    workshop. We evaluated different approaches and found container technology
    to be a good fit to abstract away the hassle of setting up the tools and
    infrastructure. We provide an implementation of what we call a \emph{sandbox
    environment} and publish it as an open source project.

    Furthermore, this thesis explores the concept of \emph{data stories}. A data
    story provides selected raw data, a motivating tangible goal and
    instructions that connect the raw data to the goal. This allows participants
    to fully focus on how the available tools interact with data and other tools
    to achieve something useful. We implement an example data that covers
    aggregating data in PostGIS and serving it as web service using Geoserver.

\section{Introduction}
Educational GIS\footnote{Geographic Information System} workshops face a few
particular challenges, two of which will be central to this thesis. Firstly, it
is generally desirable that participants can immediately experience theoretical
concepts hands-on for themselves. The challenge here lies in providing all
participants with access to the respective software and data with minimal setup
efforts. Secondly, the GIS landscape today consists of many components covering
the whole data lifecycle from initial data exploration to visualization and
distribution. Together with the myriad of commercial and open source tools for
each component, this might be overwhelming to unfamiliar participants.

This thesis is written as part of the CAS RIS 2021/22\footnote{Certificate of
advanced studies (CAS) in GIS (in German RIS) offered by ETH Zurich.}. It
explores the two above-mentioned challenges in the context of the CAS and aims
to address them on two different levels:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Infrastructure} In order to provide participants access to a
  variety of software with minimal setup effort the concept of a \emph{sandbox
  environment} is adopted. The requirements and components to be implemented in
  a first version will be chosen to support the content of this thesis' further
  education curriculum.
  \item \textbf{Content} In order to help participants to make sense of the
  sandbox components and their interactions, we introduce the concept of a
  \emph{data journey}. Each data journey has a tangible data use case goal
  statement that participants can identify with, for example: Let's visualize
  risk of wildfire and serve it as interactive map on a website. Starting from
  given raw data, participants follow the processing of this dataset through the
  different components and experience how they work together to achieve the
  goal.
\end{enumerate}

% REQUIREMENTS

\section{Requirements}
In this section we first analyze the content of the first four weeks of the CAS
RIS and assess potential for hands-on exercises. From these findings we then
derive functional and non-functional requirements\footnote{Functional
requirements specify the tasks an application must be able to perform.
Non-functional requirements specify additional aspects about the application
performing the task, for example usability, look and feel or performance. }.

% Functional requirements
%-------------
\subsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A spatial database is available together with utilities to import and
  query data.
  \item The GDAL command line utilities, particularly gdalinfo and ogr2ogr, are
  available. There is a way to read either predefined example data or read data
  from the host system.
  \item An OGC server implementation is available. There is a way to read
  predefined example data, read data from the host system or connect to the
  sandbox spatial database.
  \item An OGC client implementation is available, which can interact with the
  sandbox OGC server or any other OGC service publicly available on the
  internet.
\end{itemize}

% Non-Functional requirements
%-------------
\subsection{Non-Functional requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users can create content which is persisted between usages of the
  sandbox.
  \item There is a possibility to ship example scripts and data as part of the
  sandbox.
  \item The sandbox can be installed with minimal changes to the host system.
  \item The sandbox can be uninstalled with minimal effort and leaves behind no
  traces on the host system.
  \item A partial or total reset of applications and data is possible in case
  something got messed up.
  \item Usage is not coupled to the duration of the CAS course or otherwise
  restricted (e.g. via externally controlled credentials).
