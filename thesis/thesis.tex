\section{Introduction}
Introductionary educational GIS\footnote{Geographic Information System} workshops face a few particular challenges, two
of which will be central to this thesis. Firstly, it is generally desirable that participants can immediately experience
theoretical concepts hands-on for themselves. The challenge here lies in providing all participants with access to the
respective software and data with minimal setup efforts. Secondly, the GIS landscape today consists of many different
components covering the whole data lifecycle from initial data exploration to visualization and distribution. Together
with the myriad of commercial and open source tools for each component, this might be overwhelming to unfamiliar
participants.

This thesis is written as part of the CAS RIS 2021/22\footnote{Certificate of advanced studies (CAS) in GIS (german RIS)
offered by ETH Zurich.}. It explores the two above mentioned challenges in the context of the CAS and aims to address
them on two different levels:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Infrastructure} In order to provide participants access to a variety of software with minimal setup
  effort the concept of a \emph{sandbox environment} is adopted. The requirements and components to be implemented in a
  first version will be chosen to support the content of this thesis' further education curriculum.
  \item \textbf{Content} In order to help participants to make sense of the sandbox components and their interactions,
  we introduce the concept of a \emph{data journey}. Each data journey has a tangible data usecase goal statement that
  participants can identify with, for example: Let's visualize risk of wildfire and serve it as interactive map on a
  website. Starting from given raw data, participants follow the processing of this dataset through the different
  components and experience how they work together to achieve the goal.
\end{enumerate}
