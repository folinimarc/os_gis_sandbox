# ------------------------------------------------------
# Shapely: Does planar geometric processing (uses GEOS).
# Pygeos: Newer sibling to shapely with focus on performance. Will be integrated in shapely 2.0.
# Fiona: Reads and writes everything (uses OGR).
# Pyproj: Handles projections (uses PROJ).
# Rtree: Spatial indexing (plays well with geopandas).
# Openpyxl: Is required by geopandas to write excel files.
# Matplotlib: Is required by geopandas to visualize geometries.
# Mapclassify: Utility package for classification schemes for Choropleth Maps. Used by geopandas for GeoDataFrame.explore().
# Folium: Provides interactive plotting capbilities. Used by geopandas for GeoDataFrame.explore().
# Geopandas: Extends pandas with geospatial capabilities (uses shapely, pygeos, fiona, pyproj, Rtree, ...)
# Gdal: Low level gdal python bindings. More a nice-to-have as there are higher level packages like rasterio for interacting with gdal.
# Rasterio Makes working with rasters fun (uses GDAL).
# Xarray: Deals with multidimensional data. Ideal to read/writes netCDF files.
# Xarray-spatial: Extends xarray with powerful spatial processing capabilities without depending on GDAL.
# Xarray[io]: Various io plugins to read/write data in xarray, e.g. netCDF, GRIB,...
# Rioxarray: Extension of xarray to seamlessly interface with rasterio for 2D raster data.
# Jupyterlab: Allows to write rich scripts (notebooks) and run code interactively in the browser.
# Pysal: A collection of packages for advanced geospatial statistical modelling and visualization.
# OWSlib: A python client library to work with OGC OWS services like WMS, WFS, WCS, ...
# GeoAlchemy2: Library that allows to interact with spatial databases. Based on the SqlAlchemy.
