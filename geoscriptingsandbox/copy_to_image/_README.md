# Hey there friend - a word about file persistence?
- **Only files and folders you create are safe** and will be persisted across Sandbox
restarts. This also applies to files you create inside existing folders, because
we do not replace whole folder contents but rather reset on a file-per-file
basis inside each folder recursively.
- Existing files and folders of this Sandbox might be reset to their original
  state upon Sandbox restart.
- If you want to build upon an existing script just **copy and rename before**
starting your work! Believe me, this will save you headache down the road!

Go now brave adventurer and let's have some fun!
