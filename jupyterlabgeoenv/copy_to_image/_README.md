# Hey there friend - A minute of reading might save you a day of headaches!


## Avoid losing your work
Existing files and folders of this Sandbox might be reset to their original
state upon Sandbox restart. **Only files and folders you create are safe** and
will be persisted across Sandbox restarts. This also applies to files you create
inside existing folders, because we do not replace whole folder contents but
rather reset on a file-per-file basis inside each folder recursively.

If you want to build upon an existing script just **copy and rename before**
starting your work! Believe me, this will save you headache down the road!


## How to customize the Python environment
The Sandbox comes preinstalled with everything listed in `requirements-preinstalled.txt`. 
Feel free to install additional packages through `pip install`, they will be persisted across Sandbox restarts.

## JupyterLab extensions
JupyterLab is a modular environment and hundreds of great extensions exist.
You can install extensions via `pip install`.
