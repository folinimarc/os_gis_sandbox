    "PostGIS is more than just a database extension to store spatial data. It also allows for sophisticated data processing through many built-in spatial functions. In this section we will use PostGIS to process the road network and the district boundaries to get a new dataset that contains the ratio of roads suitable for bikes for each district.\n",

If you are interested in understanding the basics, we recommend to checkout [this tutorial for basic SQL (using PostgreSQL dialect)](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) and [this tutorial to learn about the power of the spatial extension PostGIS](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/). For the most fun hands-on experience, follow the tutorials using the Sandbox pgAdmin query interface and experiment with the data we just loaded.\n",

    "_For each district, we want to derive the ratio of total length of roads suitable for biking within that district divided by the total length of all roads within that district. To that end, we need to find the parts of the road network which intersect with each district. This needs to be done twice for all the roads and only the roads suitable for biking (which have attribute velo=1). We then want to sum up their lengths respectively and derive the ratio._\n",
