# Hey there friend - a word about file persistence?
- All files and folders you did not create in here will be **reset** every time the sandbox is restarted!
- Whatever files and folders you create are safe and will be persisted across restarts as long as the names do not clash
with existing folders and files. This also applies to files you create inside existing folders, because we do not
replace whole folder contents but rather reset on a file-per-file basis inside each folder recursively.
- If you want to build upon an existing script just **copy and rename before** starting
your work! Believe me, this will save you headache down the road!

Go now brave adventurer and let's have some fun!
