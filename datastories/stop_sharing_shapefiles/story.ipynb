    "\n",
    "To that end she sends you a NaturalEarth country shapefile and a csv with the airports. It is quite common at your company to share shapefiles with your colleagues. This has led to problems in the past whereby data inconsistency was a result of coworkers not always using the most updated version of the data and general frustration arose from keeping track of email attachments and download links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The plan\n",
    "You plan to make use of a spatial database which can be accessed by your coworkers to reduce the number of flatfiles being sent around. Furthermore, you plan to process the data in the spatial database and create a view from the result, which will automatically update when the underlying data changes. You plan your work in 3 steps:\n",
    "1. Load shapefiles and csv into PostGIS.\n",
    "2. Write a spatial query to aggregate the data in PostGIS.\n",
    "3. Create a view from the result of the spatial query.\n",
    "4. Make sure that coworkers can access the data (e.g. via QGIS)."
